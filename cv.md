<div id='center'>**Have Some Buzzwords:** Java, ​
 Scala, Python, Analytics, Spark, HBase, DevOps, AWS, Scripting</div>

### Things I’ve Done
**I currently consult with Aitheras**​ in support of their work for the US Dept. of Justice. I implemented a Random­Index Vector library in Java, translated it into Scala and Python, and built a functioning text ­analysis engine on AWS using Spark and HBase. To do this I learned Java, Scala, and Python, and how Random­Index Vectors work (from research papers), and learned Spark, HBase, HDFS, and Zookeeper. I’m currently working to implement hLDA in Java.<br/>
**In my previous position at Sonic Foundry, Inc,** in Madison, Wisconsin, I did my own devops; I heavily remodeled workflows using Batch and C# scripts to automate significant portions of what had been done manually. This saved time and money, all but eliminated transcription errors, and improved my efficiency by as much as half.<br/>
**At school,** I provided tech support​ for the student body. During my senior year, I built a customized distribution of Fedora to run on aging hardware in the school’s computer labs. I used Bash-­scripted timed ­inactivity lockouts and user ­folder overwrites to imitate the effects of DeepFreeze at zero percent of the cost.

### Things I Have
**A Bachelor’s Degree:​** Creative Writing, from Beloit College in Beloit, Wisconsin. It’s a small place, and the education is top­notch. I studied everything from cognitive science/philosophy to the American civil war to the physics of sound.<br/>
**Previous Employment:**​ I worked at Sonic Foundry for three years. I did minor QA and remote support, and I coordinated shipping for all of our Event Services and Rentals, plus side projects to keep things interesting. Before that I did tech support at Beloit, and I’ve spent a lot of time in retail.<br/>
**Lots of Nerdery:** I have both early and recent model Raspberry Pis and a laptop from Zareason, which I reformat with a new Linux every six months or so (Kubuntu, at the moment). Give me three hours to a week and I can write functional code in any language you want, and if you ever want to talk game theory, just let me know. The list of podcasts I listen to is enormous.

### Who I Am
**I love to learn.** I read Hacker News on a regular basis, mostly for the sake of seeing things I only barely understand. I enjoy sci­fi and fantasy across media, have done since I was very young. I’ve enjoyed programming languages ever since I started learning Common Lisp, and you can find me toying with something new and interesting on a semi­regular basis.

### TL;DR
**I am a generalist.**​ I am familiar with and can reason critically about everything from economics to quantum mechanics, cognitive science to film and literary theory, and I can synthesize cross­disciplinary insight better than almost anybody. I have written and used scripts in Bash, Batch, C#, F#, Common Lisp, and JavaScript, and I have played around with more programming languages than most people can name. I like to explore, and I work at seeing how things function, not what they look like. I always appreciate a good joke.
